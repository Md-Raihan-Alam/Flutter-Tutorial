Perfect! We can set up a **structured Flutter exercise progression from Level 1 to Level 100**, gradually increasing difficulty, starting with basics and ending with advanced Firebase, animations, and full project integrations.

Here’s how we will proceed:

- **Levels 1–20:** Basics – Dart fundamentals, widgets, layouts, state management, navigation.
- **Levels 21–40:** Intermediate – Lists, forms, custom widgets, theming, basic animations.
- **Levels 41–60:** Advanced UI – Complex layouts, animations, responsive design, state management (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc basics).
- **Levels 61–80:** Networking & local storage – HTTP APIs, JSON parsing, SharedPreferences, SQLite.
- **Levels 81–100:** Full-scale projects – Firebase integration (Auth, Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage), push notifications, complete apps.

Each level will have:

1. **Exercise description** – clear requirements.
2. **Expected outcome** – what the app should do.
3. **Rules for submission** – you submit the Flutter code, I review it.
4. **Scoring system** – if score < 8/10 → redo with different exercise of same difficulty.

We will **start with Level 1** today. After you complete it, you submit your code, and I review it strictly.

### **Level 1 – Your First Flutter App**

**Objective:**
Create a simple Flutter app that displays a greeting message and a button. When the button is pressed, it changes the text.

**Requirements:**

1. Use `MaterialApp` and `Scaffold`.
2. Display a `Text` widget in the center with text: `"Hello, Flutter!"`.
3. Below the text, place a `RaisedButton` or `ElevatedButton`.
4. When the button is pressed, the text changes to `"You pressed the button!"`.
5. Use `setState` to manage the state.

**Hints:**

- Widgets to use: `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `Center`, `Column`, `Text`, `ElevatedButton`.
- Use `StatefulWidget` since the text changes.

**Scoring Criteria (10 points):**

- Proper use of `MaterialApp` & `Scaffold` – 2 points
- Text displayed correctly – 2 points
- Button implemented and functional – 3 points
- Proper use of `setState` – 3 points

✅ Submit your **Flutter code** for this Level 1, and I’ll review it strictly.

Do you want me to **also give a diagram of the UI layout** for Level 1 to make it easier to visualize?
